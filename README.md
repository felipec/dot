`dot-team` is a collection of collaborative distributed configuration files ([dotfiles][]).

We borrow from `git`'s philosophy: it's a **distributed** system of configurations. If you think a
configuration might be useful to other people, don't hesitate and contribute it to the upstream
project.

There is no point in thousands of people creating essentially the same configurations time and time
again, when by doing a little bit of extra work we can properly store our configurations either in a
private repository, a personal public repository, or the canonical upstream repository.

The main point of `dot-team` isn't to store and manage configurations--there's many projects already
that do that--the main point is to **share** our configurations and work in a collaborative manner.
